# Before you start

## Use Bun to run the local environment

This project use Bun runtime to manage and run the application in a local environment.

You need to install it on your system to run the application.

[Link to the project documentation](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)

## Or use node with npm

You can also use the classic npm to install and run the application but since we are aiming for a modern web application we prefer using bun instead.

# Install the application packages with Bun

```bash
bun install
```

## Â Using NPM instead

```bash
npm i
```

# Run the application

## Bun

```bash
bun dev
```

## Npm

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
